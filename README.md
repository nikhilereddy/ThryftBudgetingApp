## ‚ú® 1. Introduction

The Thryft Budget App is an online mobile application built using Kotlin and Android Studio. It is designed to empower individuals with meaningful insights into their spending and saving habits, providing a structured yet flexible interface for managing daily finances.

This application is centered around the core principles of budgeting ‚Äî planning income, tracking expenses, comparing against limits, and ultimately helping users stay financially healthy. In its current prototype, the app stores data locally using RoomDB, offering full functionality without requiring internet access.

Firebase integration for cloud sync and authentication is prepared and will be introduced in future updates.

## üåü 2. Purpose

The purpose of the Thryft Budget App is to create a user-friendly, engaging mobile application that helps users manage their personal finances effectively. The app aims to simplify the often tedious and stressful task of budgeting by allowing users to track their spending habits, set savings goals, and monitor their financial progress in an intuitive and enjoyable way. A key focus is incorporating gamification elements to make the budgeting process fun and rewarding, encouraging consistent use. The app is designed to assist users in categorizing expenses, setting budgets, visualizing spending trends, and storing data both locally and online for accessibility across devices.

### - Core objectives:

\-- Enable users to register and log in securely with a email and password, using Firebase Auth.
\-- Allow users to create and categorize expenses (e.g., "Groceries," "Entertainment," "Transport").
\-- Support entry with details such as amount, description, transaction type (e.g. toggle between income or expense), category, and optionally add a photo from gallery or camera.
\-- Facilitate the setting of monthly budget goals and category-specific limits.
\-- Provide a visual dashboard to track progress against budget goals, highlighting overspending.
\-- Display spending trends through graphs for user-selectable periods.
\-- Incorporate gamification features like rewards or badges for meeting budget goals or consistent logging.
\-- Store data in an online database Firebase (Firestore DB) for the final submission to enable cross-device access.

## üé® 3. Design Decisions

The design decisions for the app are informed by the research, planning, and implementation requirements. These decisions aim to ensure functionality, usability, and engagement while adhering to the technical and academic requirements of the course.

### Key design decisions:

* User Interface (UI) Design
  \-- Intuitive and Engaging Layout: The UI is designed to be appealing and easy to navigate, addressing the perception that budgeting is tedious.
  \-- Error Handling: The app is built to handle invalid user inputs gracefully without crashing.
  \-- Gamification Elements: Includes badges or rewards for meeting budget goals.
  \-- Visual Feedback: Graphs and dashboards to quickly convey budget progress.

* Functionality and Features
  \-- Graphical Representation: A graph shows daily spending by category over a selectable period.
  \-- Progress Dashboard: Displays how well users are staying within budget.
  \-- Online Database: Uses Firebase for cross-device data syncing.
  \-- Custom Features: Includes export and dark/light mode.

* User Experience Considerations
  \-- Engaging and stress-free design
  \-- Clean UI with error handling
  \-- Ability to attach receipt images
